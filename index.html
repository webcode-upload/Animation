					<p>Cartoon Art Gallery founded by artist <b>Shivani sharma</b> and cartoonist Shivani sharma in 2015
						stands today as one of the country’s distinguished and well-defined center of contemporary art
						promoting paintings, sculptures, photography, cartoon art and ceramics. Endorsing the computer
						as an artistic tool the gallery has braced itself to present new media, digital installations,
						and projection mapping that enhance the viewer experience. The gallery’s interests include art
						promotion and exhibition, art advisory and art education.

						Over the past 4 years with well documented and curated shows to its credit in India and abroad
						and a presence in art fairs, the gallery pledges to promote young and established artists to
						create a greater drive towards the popularization of the arts. The gallery has for 2017 seen
						musicians like Maestro Balamurali krishna, Madhav Chari, Anil Srinivasan, Sikkil Grucharan, and
						eminent dancers like Dato Ramli Ibrahim of Sutra Dance Academy KL and Anita Ratnam present their
						repertoire in connection with curated art exhibitions. Art symposiums, workshops, poetry reading
						and varied art collectives being conducted at Forum make it a unique progressive gallery in the
						Indian visual artscape.

						ARTINK is cartoon’s dedicated art education program for children and adults conducted at the
						gallery premises. The gallery has over the years reached out to physically challenged and
						terminally ill children to facilitate art therapy for healing and well being,

						Embracing the arts, cartoon’s commitment to excellence remains its foremost priority and leans
						towards ICE- Innovation, collaboration and exposure in the national and international art
						market.

						Forum continues to strive beyond the commercial, to be of value to society, to have a wider
						reach implementing its philosophy of art education, service and awareness.
